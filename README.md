# SpectralClassificationProject
A HackFMI project

Part of a Python101 course at:
https://hackbulgaria.com

We use Django web framework, to create a website, containing interactive work with stellar spectra. 
The main idea of the project is to add web interface to mkclass ( http://www.appstate.edu/~grayro/mkclass/ )
The user will be able to upload a spectrum in txt file and get it classified by mkclass. 
The input spectra, as well as the closest template from the mk class library will be visualized
with python "bokeh" module, which allows easy implementation of responsive and intercative graphs in the Web.
